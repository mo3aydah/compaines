# Product Context: Greetings Card Generator

## Why the Project Exists
- **Problem**: Users need a simple, branded way to create personalized Ramadan/Eid greeting cards without design tools.
- **Solution**: A guided web flow: pick a company card and language, then choose message, add name, and download—all in one place.

## Target Audience
- End users sending Ramadan/Eid wishes (personal or professional).
- Arabic- and English-speaking users; UI and messages must support both.

## User Experience (High Level)

*Diagram: User flow from landing (company showcase + language) through the three personalization steps to download.*

1. **Landing**: User sees previews of all company cards and selects a language (Arabic or English). Choosing a card enters the flow for that company.
2. **Step 1 – Message**: User picks one of the pre-defined messages (shown in the selected language).
3. **Step 2 – Name**: User enters the name to appear on the card.
4. **Step 3 – Preview & Download**: User sees the final card and downloads it as PNG.

## Critical Success Factors (User Perspective)
- Clear preview of each company card before starting.
- Obvious language switch and consistent use of that language for all steps.
- Minimal steps (three) after landing.
- Reliable preview and download with correct fonts and layout (including RTL for Arabic).

## Product Vision
A single, multi-company greeting card hub where users choose a card and language, then quickly personalize and download—with a navy-themed, responsive UI and optional analytics (e.g. SheetDB).

# Project Brief: Greetings Card Generator

## Primary Objectives
- Deliver a **bilingual (Arabic/English) multi-step greetings card generator** for Ramadan/Eid celebrations.
- Allow users to **preview all company cards**, choose a **language**, then complete **three steps**: message selection, name entry, preview and download.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Landing experience**: Showcase of all company greeting cards with language selection (Arabic or English).
2. **Three-step flow** (after company and language chosen):
   - Step 1: Message selection (language-specific).
   - Step 2: Name entry.
   - Step 3: Preview and download (PNG).
3. **Per-company card experience**: Each company has its own card design and optional entry point; current focus is Almanaa (Ramadan post card).

## Stakeholder Expectations
- Users can browse company cards and choose one before personalizing.
- Full UI switches to selected language for the rest of the session.
- Real-time canvas preview and one-click PNG download.
- Responsive, usable on desktop and mobile.

## Constraints and Boundaries
- **Scope**: Ramadan/Eid greeting cards; bilingual (Arabic, English) only.
- **Technical**: Client-side web app (HTML, CSS, JavaScript); Canvas for rendering; optional SheetDB for tracking.
- **Companies**: Documented current company is Almanaa; structure must support multiple companies on the landing/showcase.
